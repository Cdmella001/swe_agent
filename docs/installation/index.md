# Setting up SWE-agent

We currently offer three options:

1. Run SWE-agent completely **in your browser**: This is done using GitHub pages, basically a VSCode environment that runs in your browser. All necessary packages will be pre-installed, so you can get started directly. Read more [here](codespaces.md).

2. **Local installation**: Install SWE-agent from source using `pip`. Read more [here](source.md).

3. **Fully containerized** deployment using docker: Pull a docker container and directly run SWE-agent. This is our fallback solution if the local installation does not work for you. Read more [here](docker.md).

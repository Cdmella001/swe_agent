# More installation tips

If you seem to be having issues with running docker

* Make sure that you allow the use of the Docker socket. In Docker desktop, click *Settings* > *Advanced* > *Allow the default Docker socket to be used (requires password)*
* If your docker installation uses a different socket, you might have to symlink them, see [this command for example](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent/issues/20#issuecomment-2047506005)

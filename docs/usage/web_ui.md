# Using the web interface

To start our web UI, simply run

```bash
./start_web_ui.sh
```

from the root of the repository.

If the user interface doesn't automatically open in your browser, please open it at `http://localhost:3000`.

!!! warning "Limitations"
    Currently, the web interface only has a subset of the options of the command line interface (CLI).

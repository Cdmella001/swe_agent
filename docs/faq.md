# Frequently Asked Questions

> How can I change the demonstrations given to SWE-agent?

See [here](config/demonstrations.md).

> Does SWE-agent run on windows?

You can run it in a [docker container](installation/docker.md), though this is not our first
choice for running SWE-agent. We're open to merge simple fixes to make the [development setup](installation/source.md)
work.

> Do you support LM X?

Currently our model support is limited. SWE-agent will generally not perform well with small/cheap models.
